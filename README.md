## Hi there 👋

I’m a developer with a lot of experience who enjoys making things with code in my spare time, mostly using TypeScript ⚡️.

I work at a large development house and use this space to build, experiment, and keep track of projects outside of day-to-day work. I’m particularly interested in maps 🗺️, data 📊, and history 📚, and how software can be used to explore and represent complex systems.

Lately, I’ve been learning how to use AI 🤖 to build applications, as well as how to design systems that are robust and usable by multiple parties.
